    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will practice many of the concepts learned in training, including exploring, cleaning up and merging data sets with Pandas, creating calculated fields and interactive visualizations and dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import packages below.\n",
    "2. Load up the following two data sets from the ExData folder:\n",
    "- sp500_SectorData.csv - this contains sector information of each of the S&P500 constitutents\n",
    "- sp500_Cos_ValMetrics.csv - this contains valuation metrics of the S&P500 companies\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Merge the two dataframes into one table.\n",
    "4. Box Plots - create two different boxplot graphs with Seaborn:\n",
    "    - One showing distribution of Betas by GICS Sector\n",
    "    - One showing EV/Revenue by GICS Sector\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. You will notice that one of the graphs is skewed due to outliers. Explore the data to understand which companies represent those outliers. (Hint: perform a filter on the EV/Revenue column). What do you notice is common about the companies?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Recreate the second Box Plot without the outliers found.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Apply a \"cleaning up\" function on the Enterprise Value column to remove the B's and T's and convert the billions and trillions values into USD$ millions.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Create a dashboard that allows the user to pick from two dropdowns the following:\n",
    "- GICS Sector to plot\n",
    "- Type of graph to show\n",
    "\n",
    "The options for graphs should be:\n",
    "- a Plotly Sunburst chart: https://plotly.com/python/sunburst-charts/\n",
    "- a Plotly Tree Map chart: https://plotly.com/python/treemaps/\n",
    "- a Plotly Bar chart with GICS Sub-Industry as the x-axis: https://plotly.com/python/bar-charts/\n",
    "\n",
    "All three charts should show EV in USD millions as the value. For the Sunburst and Tree Map, the \"path\" should be: GICS Sub-Industry --> Symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Use an if statement in the function tied to the interactive widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the dashboard through Voila preview to interact with the widgets without seeing the codes."
